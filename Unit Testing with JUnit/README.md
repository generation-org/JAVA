### Unit Testing with JUnit


#### Part 1: Writing Unit Tests

1. Open the model.calculator package and explore the classes and what they do.

2. Open the *Calculator* class and identify which methods work for the following scenarios:
* Adding numbers
* Subtracting numbers
* Multiplying numbers
* Dividing numbers

3. Implement the following unit tests in the *CalculatorTest* class:

     ```java
        @Test
        public void addTest(){
    
        }
    
        @Test
        public void subtractTest(){
    
        }
   
        @Test
        public void multplyTest(){
    
        }
    
        @Test
        public void divideTest(){
    
        }

     ```
#### Part 2: Test Driven Development
1. Implement the following unit test so it fails:
     ```java
        @Test
        public void remainderTest(){
    
        }
     ```
#### Part 3: Writing Tests for Edge Cases
1. Think of 2 edge cases that have not been tested. Write a unit test for each case. 

#### Challenge Yourself
1. You implemented a remainderTest() method earlier that fails. Write some code in the calculator class to make this test pass.
