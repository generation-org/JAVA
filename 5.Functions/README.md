# Functions 

 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 ## Part 1:

1. Download the project and import it into IntelliJ Idea
2. Implement the following functions:

  ```java
      private static void printNameLength( String name )
      {
        //TODO implement this code
      }

      private static void printNameCharacters( String name )
      {
        //TODO implement this code
      }

  ```
3. Test your code with 5 different names and verify that the behaviour is correct.
4. Modify your code to also capture from the user the last name.
5. Implement an additional function that prints the FUll name of the person.

 ## Part 2:
 
 Create a new Java class that will have the following functionality:
 
 1. Name should be CalculatorBrain
 2. Implement a function for each aritmetic operation
 * Addition
 * Subtraction
 * Multiplication
 * Division
 3. Add some code to the *main* method to invoke the aritmetic functions defined and verify it works as expected.
 
## Challenge yourself
Add some more functionality to your *CalculatorBrain*:
* Square Root
* Power Of
